                <h1>What is HTTP?</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web,
                        and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application
                        layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and
                        runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over
                        HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a
                        response message.

                    <h1>What's in an HTTP request?</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            An HTTP request is the way internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the
                            information they need to load a website Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with
                            it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information. A typical HTTP request
                            contains:
                            <ol>
                                <li>HTTP version type</li>
                                <li>A URL</li>
                                <li>An HTTP method</li>
                                <li>HTTP request headers</li>
                                <li>Optional HTTP body.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Let’s explore in greater depth how these requests work, and how the contents of a request can be used to share information.

                    <div>
                        <h1>What’s an HTTP method?</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>

                                An HTTP method, sometimes referred to as an HTTP verb, indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from
                                the queried server. For example, two of the most common HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; a ‘GET’ request expects
                                information back in return (usually in the form of a website), while a ‘POST’ request typically indicates that the
                                client is submitting information to the web server (such as form information, e.g. a submitted username and password).

                    <div>
                        <h1>What are HTTP request headers?</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                HTTP headers contain text information stored in key-value pairs, and they are included in every HTTP request
                                (and response, more on that later). These headers communicate core information, such as what browser the client
                                is using what data is being requested.
                                Example of HTTP request headers from Google Chrome's network tab:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <img src="~/Content/MyContent/images/httpheader.jpg" />
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <div>
                        <h1>What’s in an HTTP response body?</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Successful HTTP responses to ‘GET’ requests generally have a body which contains the requested information.
                                In most web requests, this is HTML data which a web browser will translate into a web page.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <h1>Can DDoS attacks be launched over HTTP?</h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>

                                Keep in mind that HTTP is a “stateless” protocol, which means that each command runs independent of any other command.
                                In the original spec, HTTP requests each created and closed a TCP connection. In newer versions of the HTTP protocol
                                (HTTP 1.1 and above), persistent connection allows for multiple HTTP requests to pass over a persistent TCP connection,
                                improving resource consumption. In the context of DoS or DDoS attacks, HTTP requests in large quantities can be
                                used to mount an attack on a target device, and are considered part of application layer attacks or layer 7 attacks.
